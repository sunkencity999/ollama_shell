# Enhanced Agentic Assistant - File Creation Implementation Details

This document provides a detailed explanation of the implementation for handling file creation tasks in the Enhanced Agentic Assistant.

## Overview

The file creation functionality has been enhanced to solve several issues:

1. **Task Classification**: Properly identifying file creation tasks and distinguishing them from web browsing tasks
2. **Direct Handling**: Bypassing the complex task management system for simple file creation tasks
3. **Error Prevention**: Avoiding the "Only one live display may be active at once" error
4. **Robust Filename Extraction**: Extracting filenames from task descriptions using multiple patterns
5. **Improved Result Display**: Ensuring filenames and content previews are displayed correctly

## Implementation Details

### 1. Enhanced Agentic Assistant

The `EnhancedAgenticAssistant` class has been updated with the following changes:

#### 1.1 Direct File Creation Detection

The `execute_task` method now includes comprehensive patterns to detect file creation tasks:

```python
direct_file_creation_patterns = [
    "create a poem", "write a poem", "save a poem",
    "create a story", "write a story", "save a story",
    "create a file", "write a file", "save a file",
    "create a text", "write a text", "save a text",
    "create a document", "write a document", "save a document",
    "create an essay", "write an essay", "save an essay",
    "create a report", "write a report", "save a report"
]
```

When a task matches these patterns, it is handled directly by the `_handle_file_creation` method, bypassing the task management system.

#### 1.2 File Creation Handler

The `_handle_file_creation` method has been implemented to handle file creation tasks directly:

```python
async def _handle_file_creation(self, task_description: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """
    Handle file creation tasks directly, bypassing the task management system.
    """
    logger.info(f"Handling file creation task directly: {task_description}")
    
    try:
        # Extract the filename from the task description using regex patterns
        filename = None
        
        # Pattern 1: "save it to/as/in [filename]"
        save_as_match = re.search(r'save\s+(?:it|this|the\s+\w+)\s+(?:to|as|in)\s+[\'\"]*(\w+\.\w+)[\'\"]', task_description, re.IGNORECASE)
        if save_as_match:
            filename = save_as_match.group(1).strip()
        
        # Additional patterns...
        
        # Use the AgenticOllama's create_file method directly
        result = await self.agentic_ollama.create_file(task_description, filename)
        
        # Extract and format the result data
        success = result.get("success", False)
        message = result.get("message", "File creation completed")
        
        # Extract the result data
        result_data = {}
        if success and "result" in result and isinstance(result["result"], dict):
            result_data = {
                "filename": result["result"].get("filename", "Unknown"),
                "file_type": result["result"].get("file_type", "txt"),
                "content_preview": result["result"].get("content_preview", "No preview available")
            }
        
        return {
            "success": success,
            "task_type": "file_creation",
            "result": result_data,
            "message": message
        }
        
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Error handling file creation task: {str(e)}")
        return {
            "success": False,
            "task_type": "file_creation",
            "error": str(e),
            "message": f"Failed to create file: {str(e)}"
        }
```

### 2. Task Manager

The `TaskManager` class has been updated to better handle file creation tasks:

#### 2.1 Task Planner System Prompt

The system prompt for the task planner has been updated to better distinguish between file creation and web browsing tasks:

```python
When planning a task, please categorize it appropriately:
- Use "file_creation" for tasks that involve creating or writing files (e.g., "write a poem", "create a story")
- Use "web_browsing" for tasks that require searching the web or accessing online information
```

#### 2.2 Task Executor

The `TaskExecutor` class has been enhanced with the following changes:

##### 2.2.1 File Creation Task Detection

The `execute_task` method now includes comprehensive indicators to detect file creation tasks:

```python
file_creation_indicators = [
    # File-specific indicators
    "create a file", "write a file", "save to file", "save a file",
    "write to file", "save as file", "create new file", "make a file",
    # Content type indicators
    "create a story", "write a story", "save story", "write story",
    # Additional indicators...
]
```

##### 2.2.2 Task Reclassification

The method now reclassifies web browsing tasks to file creation tasks when appropriate:

```python
# If task is categorized as web_browsing but contains file creation indicators,
# reclassify it as file_creation
if task.task_type == "web_browsing" and any(indicator in task_lower for indicator in file_creation_indicators):
    logger.info(f"Reclassifying task from web_browsing to file_creation: {task.description}")
    task.task_type = "file_creation"
```

##### 2.2.3 Specialized File Creation Handler

A new method `_handle_file_creation_task` has been added to handle file creation tasks with specialized processing:

```python
async def _handle_file_creation_task(self, task: Task, enhanced_description: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """
    Handle file creation tasks with specialized processing.
    """
    logger.info(f"Using direct file creation handler for task: {task.description}")
    
    try:
        # First try to use the assistant's specialized method if available
        if hasattr(self.agentic_assistant, "_handle_file_creation"):
            result = await self.agentic_assistant._handle_file_creation(enhanced_description)
        else:
            # Fallback to standard execution
            result = await self.agentic_assistant.execute_task(enhanced_description)
        
        # Ensure the result has the correct structure
        if result.get("success", False):
            # Make sure we have a properly formatted result
            if "result" not in result or not isinstance(result["result"], dict):
                result["result"] = {}
            
            # Ensure we have the required fields
            if "filename" not in result["result"]:
                # Try to extract filename from task description
                filename = self._extract_filename_from_task(task.description)
                result["result"]["filename"] = filename or "document.txt"
            
            # Additional field handling...
        
        return result
        
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Error handling file creation task: {str(e)}")
        return {
            "success": False,
            "task_type": "file_creation",
            "error": str(e),
            "message": f"Failed to create file: {str(e)}"
        }
```

##### 2.2.4 Robust Filename Extraction

A new method `_extract_filename_from_task` has been added to extract filenames from task descriptions:

```python
def _extract_filename_from_task(self, task_description: str) -> Optional[str]:
    """
    Extract a filename from the task description using various patterns.
    """
    # Pattern 1: "save it to/as/in [filename]"
    save_as_match = re.search(r'save\s+(?:it|this|the\s+\w+)\s+(?:to|as|in)\s+[\'\"]*([\\w\\-\\.]+)[\'\"]*', task_description, re.IGNORECASE)
    if save_as_match:
        return save_as_match.group(1).strip()
    
    # Additional patterns...
    
    # If no filename was found, try to generate one based on content type
    content_types = {
        "story": "story.txt",
        "poem": "poem.txt",
        "essay": "essay.txt",
        # Additional content types...
    }
    
    for content_type, default_filename in content_types.items():
        if content_type in task_description.lower():
            return default_filename
    
    # Default fallback
    return None
```

### 3. Testing

A comprehensive test script `test_file_creation.py` has been created to verify the functionality:

```python
async def test_direct_file_creation():
    """Test direct file creation with the Enhanced Agentic Assistant"""
    print("\n=== Testing Direct File Creation ===\n")
    
    # Initialize the Enhanced Agentic Assistant with mocked AgenticOllama
    assistant = EnhancedAgenticAssistant()
    assistant.agentic_ollama.create_file = mock.AsyncMock(side_effect=mock_create_file)
    
    # Test cases for direct file creation
    test_cases = [
        "Create a file with a short story about a boy who loves ham sandwiches in Africa",
        "Write a poem about the sunset and save it as sunset_poem.txt",
        "Create a document called shopping_list.txt with items I need to buy",
        "Write an essay about artificial intelligence"
    ]
    
    # Test execution...
```

## Key Benefits

1. **Improved Task Classification**: The system now correctly identifies file creation tasks using comprehensive patterns and indicators.

2. **Direct Handling**: File creation tasks are now handled directly, bypassing the complex task management system when appropriate.

3. **Robust Filename Extraction**: The system extracts filenames from task descriptions using multiple patterns and fallback mechanisms.

4. **Enhanced Error Handling**: The system recovers gracefully from errors and misclassifications.

5. **Better User Experience**: Users can now create files with natural language commands without encountering errors.

## Conclusion

These changes ensure that when a user requests to create a file (like a short story), the system will correctly identify it as a file creation task, extract the appropriate filename, and handle it properly, displaying the filename and content preview in the results. The "Only one live display may be active at once" error has been eliminated by preventing nested task management for file creation tasks.
