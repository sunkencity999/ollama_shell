{"prompt": "Unusually large and intense forest fires swept the tropics in 1997. The tropics were quite susceptible to fire at that time because of the widespread drought caused by an unusually strong El Nino, an occasional global weather phenomenon. Many scientists believe the strength of the El Nino was enhanced by the global warming caused by air pollution. Which one of the following can be properly inferred from the information above?\nA: Forest fires in the tropics are generally larger and more intense than usual during a strong El Nino.\nB: If the El Nino in 1997 had not been unusually strong, few if any large and intense forest fires would have swept the tropics in that year.\nC: Air pollution was largely responsible for the size and intensity of the forest fires that swept the tropics in 1997.\nD: If air pollution enhanced the strength of the El Nino in 1997, then it also contributed to the widespread drought in that year.", "completion": "D"}

Since the base of the triangle is a diameter of the circle, its length is $2r = 12$ cm. To maximize the height of the triangle, I want to choose the other two vertices of the triangle such that they are as far away from the diameter as possible. I realize that this means the other two vertices must lie on the circle, and they must be symmetric about the diameter. This means the triangle is actually a right triangle, and the height is equal to the radius of the circle, which is $6$ cm. Therefore, the area of the triangle is $\\frac{1}{2} \\times 12 \\times 6 = 36$ square centimeters. "}
