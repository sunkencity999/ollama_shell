# Updated Installation Script for Ollama Shell

This document explains the updated installation process for Ollama Shell, which now includes the enhanced file creation task handling.

## Overview

The updated installation script (`install_updated.sh`) combines the standard Ollama Shell installation with the improved file creation task handling. This ensures that new users can install the application with a single command and immediately benefit from the enhanced file creation capabilities.

## What's New

The updated installation script includes the following enhancements:

1. **Improved File Creation Task Handling**
   - Better detection of file creation tasks
   - Robust filename extraction from task descriptions
   - Intelligent fallback for cases where no filename is specified
   - Enhanced result display with proper filenames and content previews

2. **Seamless Integration**
   - The fixed file handler is automatically installed
   - The enhanced Agentic Assistant is integrated if available
   - Backups of original files are created for safety

## Installation

### For New Users

New users can simply run the updated installation script:

```bash
./install_updated.sh
```

This will install Ollama Shell with all the enhancements.

### For Existing Users

Existing users who want to update their installation can run:

```bash
./install_fixed_assistant.sh
```

This will update the Agentic Assistant with the improved file creation task handling.

## Testing

To verify that the installation was successful, you can run the test scripts:

```bash
./run_updated_test.sh
```

or

```bash
./run_simple_test.sh
```

These scripts will test the file creation task handling with various test cases.

## Updating the Main Installation Script
