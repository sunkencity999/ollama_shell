# Enhanced Task Management for Ollama Shell

This document describes the enhanced task management system for Ollama Shell, which enables the Assistant to handle complex, multi-step tasks more effectively.

## Overview

The enhanced task management system extends the original Ollama Shell Assistant with the following capabilities:

1. **Task Planning**: Breaking down complex tasks into manageable subtasks
2. **Dependency Management**: Tracking dependencies between subtasks
3. **State Management**: Maintaining state across task execution
4. **Workflow Persistence**: Saving and resuming task workflows
5. **Progress Tracking**: Monitoring task execution progress

## Components

The system consists of the following components:

### 1. TaskManager

The `TaskManager` class is responsible for:
- Creating and managing task workflows
- Adding tasks to workflows
- Tracking task dependencies
- Updating task status
- Persisting workflow state to disk

### 2. TaskPlanner

The `TaskPlanner` class is responsible for:
- Analyzing complex tasks using LLM
- Breaking down complex tasks into subtasks
- Determining dependencies between subtasks
- Creating a structured execution plan

### 3. TaskExecutor

The `TaskExecutor` class is responsible for:
- Executing tasks in the correct order based on dependencies
- Handling task failures and retries
- Collecting and managing task artifacts
- Providing progress updates

### 4. EnhancedAgenticAssistant

The `EnhancedAgenticAssistant` class extends the original `AgenticAssistant` with:
- Integration with the task management system
- Automatic detection of complex tasks
- Visual representation of task plans and results
- Improved error handling and recovery

## Usage

### Command-Line Interface

The enhanced assistant can be used through the command-line interface:

```bash
# Execute a task
./assistant_cli.py execute "Research the latest gaming news, create a summary document, and find images of the top 3 games mentioned"

# Enter interactive mode
./assistant_cli.py interactive

# List saved workflows
./assistant_cli.py list

# View workflow details
./assistant_cli.py view <workflow_id>

# Resume a workflow
./assistant_cli.py resume <workflow_id>
```

### Programmatic Usage

```python
from agentic_assistant_enhanced import EnhancedAgenticAssistant

# Initialize the assistant
assistant = EnhancedAgenticAssistant()

# Execute a complex task
result = await assistant.execute_task("Research the latest gaming news, create a summary document, and find images of the top 3 games mentioned")

# Display the result
print(f"Task completed: {result['success']}")
print(f"Message: {result['message']}")
```

## How It Works

1. **Task Detection**: The system automatically detects if a task is complex based on linguistic patterns and the presence of multiple action verbs.

2. **Task Planning**: For complex tasks, the system uses the LLM to generate a structured plan with subtasks and dependencies.

3. **Task Execution**: The system executes tasks in the correct order, respecting dependencies between tasks.

4. **Artifact Management**: Results from each task are stored as artifacts and can be used by dependent tasks.

5. **Progress Tracking**: The system provides real-time progress updates during task execution.

## Example Workflow

When a user requests a complex task like "Research the latest gaming news, create a summary document, and find images of the top 3 games mentioned", the system might generate the following plan:

1. **Task 1**: Browse gaming news websites to gather headlines (task_type: web_browsing)
2. **Task 2**: Create a summary document based on the gathered headlines (task_type: file_creation, depends on Task 1)
3. **Task 3**: Extract names of top 3 games from the summary (task_type: general_task, depends on Task 2)
4. **Task 4**: Search for images of each game (task_type: image_search, depends on Task 3)
5. **Task 5**: Create a final report combining the summary and images (task_type: file_creation, depends on Tasks 2 and 4)

The system then executes these tasks in order, maintaining state and passing information between them as needed.

## Benefits

The enhanced task management system provides several benefits:

1. **Improved Task Handling**: Better handling of complex, multi-step tasks
2. **Persistent State**: Maintenance of state between task steps
3. **Failure Recovery**: Ability to resume workflows after failures
4. **Progress Visibility**: Clear visibility into task execution progress
5. **Structured Output**: More organized and detailed task results

## Future Enhancements

Potential future enhancements to the system include:

1. **Parallel Task Execution**: Executing independent tasks in parallel
2. **Task Optimization**: Optimizing task execution order for efficiency
3. **Interactive Task Planning**: Allowing users to modify task plans before execution
4. **Task Templates**: Creating reusable templates for common complex tasks
5. **Task History**: Maintaining a history of executed tasks and their results
