# Task Management Fixes Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the fixes and improvements made to the task management system in the Enhanced Agentic Assistant.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Filename Extraction
- Fixed syntax errors in regex patterns for filename extraction
- Improved pattern matching to handle a wider variety of filename formats
- Added support for quoted filenames (both single and double quotes)
- Ensured proper extension handling (.txt is added when no extension is specified)

### 2. Task Classification
- Enhanced detection of web browsing tasks vs. file creation tasks
- Improved handling of complex tasks that involve both web browsing and file creation
- Added better detection of domain names and URLs
- Fixed classification of tasks that mention "create", "write", or "save"

### 3. Test Coverage
- Created comprehensive test scripts to verify the fixes:
  - `test_fixes.py`: Tests basic filename extraction and task classification
  - `test_web_detection.py`: Specifically tests web browsing task detection
  - `test_task_management_fixes.py`: Comprehensive async tests for all functionality

## Test Results
All tests are now passing, confirming that:
- Filename extraction correctly identifies and formats filenames from various task descriptions
- Task classification properly distinguishes between web browsing and file creation tasks
- Complex tasks that involve both web browsing and file creation are correctly classified

## Technical Details

### Improved Regex Patterns
- Fixed syntax errors in pattern6 and other regex patterns
- Enhanced patterns to better match various filename formats
- Added proper escaping for special characters in regex patterns

### Enhanced Task Detection Logic
- Added more comprehensive patterns to detect file creation tasks
- Implemented complex pattern matching for tasks like 'write a story and save it'
- Added fallback detection for tasks that mention 'create', 'write', or 'save'

## Next Steps
1. Consider adding more comprehensive tests for edge cases
2. Monitor the system for any regressions or new issues
3. Consider further enhancements to the task classification system
