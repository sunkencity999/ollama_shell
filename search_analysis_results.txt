* Solarwas the only primary source of generation that recorded capacity growth, which jumped 88% to 18.6 gigawatts (GW). As a result, in 2024, solar surpassed hydropower and nuclear as the fourth-largest source of installed capacity, after wind.3
* Windcapacity additions fell by 14% to 2.6 GW amid continued supply chain, financing, and permitting challenges.4Wind generation reached a new record, however, as it exceeded coal-fired generation for two months in a row for the first time.5
* Battery storageaccounted for the second-largest share of total generating capacity additions, rising by 64% to 7.4 GW.6Excess wind and solar generation is the third-largest use case that utilities report for batteries, following arbitrage and frequency regulation.7
* Technological innovation
* Carbon management
* On the demand side, many cleantech manufacturing, data center, and direct air capture (DAC) operators are seeking to meet their infrastructural load growth needs with significant shares of renewables.
